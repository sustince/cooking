			<h1>The 80/20 rule</h1>
			<p>The <sup>80</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> rule suggests that you shouldn&rsquo;t completely restrict yourself from food indulgences, only make sure that most of the time that you are eating nutritious food.</p>

<p>In practice, this means eating healthy 80 percent of the time, eating healthy for your meals, and potentially eating some treats occasionally, or eating fast food once in a while.</p>
