The 80/20 rule suggests that you shouldn't completely restrict yourself from food indulgences, only make sure that most of the time that you are eating nutritious food.

In practice, this means eating healthy 80 percent of the time, eating healthy for your meals, and potentially eating some treats occasionally, or eating fast food once in a while.
