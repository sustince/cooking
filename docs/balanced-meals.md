## What are balanced meals?

A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance.

## What to eat for a balanced diet

A healthy, balanced diet will usually include the following nutrients:

 - vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants
 - carbohydrates, including starches and fiber
 - protein
 - healthy fats

A balanced diet will include a variety of foods from the following groups:

 - fruits
 - vegetables
 - grains
 - dairy
 - protein foods

You should mostly avoid highly processed foods, as they are prone to having decreased nutrients and vitamins, while having extra sugar and salt.

Fruits
: Fruits are extremely nutrient dense. They can be sweet, while being fresh and good for the body. The sugar in fruits are natural, and fruits also provide fiber and other nutrients.

Vegetables
: Vegetables are a key source of essential vitamins and minerals. Leafy greens such as spinach and broccoli are great source of many nutrients.

Grains
: Grains such as bread and rice have limited nutritional value, but provide many carbohydrates. They should be eaten less, but are still important. Whole grain products include the entire grain (the outside shell), which provides additional vitamins, minerals and fiber, which are healthier.

Proteins
: Meats are primary sources of protein, which are essential for many things in the body. They can be substituted with beans, nuts or soy products, which still provide lots of protein, though less dense.

Dairy
: Dairy products provide nutrients, including protein, calcium and vitamin D which are essential to bodily functions. They also contain fat, which can increase your energy levels, but too much fat can increase calories above what the body needs and may lead to weight gain.
